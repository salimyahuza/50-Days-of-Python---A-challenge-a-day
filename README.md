# 50 Days of Python - A Challenge a Day
Welcome to my 50 Days of Python repository! ðŸŽ‰

## My Journey
Hello everyone! My name is Salim Yahuza Gwarjo and this repository is part of my commitment to mastering Python. Iâ€™ve decided to embark on a 50-day journey, solving one Python challenge each day. My goal is to not only enhance my programming skills but also explore new concepts and have a lot of fun along the way.

## Why Python?
I chose Python because of its versatility and ease of use. Whether itâ€™s web development, data analysis, automation, or even AI, Python is a powerful tool that opens up countless possibilities. Through this challenge, I hope to deepen my understanding of Python and build a solid foundation for future projects.
